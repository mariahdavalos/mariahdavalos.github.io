This app queries Marta for currently active train schedules and returns them in a list, including the line,
direction, arrival time, detination, and arrival station.

Due to mixed content issues, the page served up at [the corresponding GithubPages](https://mariahdavalos.github.io/) only shows test data.

However, if you'd like to see this in realtime, clone the repository and run <code>npm app-install</code> and then <code>npm-start</code> from the root directory. You should see the app operate in real time from there.

Thanks!
