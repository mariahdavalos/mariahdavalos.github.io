This app queries Marta for currently active train schedules and returns them in a list, including the line,
direction, arrival time, detination, and arrival station.

Due to mixed content issues, the page served up at [the corresponding GithubPages](https://mariahdavalos.github.io/) only shows demo data.

However, if you'd like to see this in realtime, clone the repository. The .env files are included in the <code>ma/marta-app-assesment</code> branch in the api, app, and root folder and will need to have the marta api key added as the REACT_APP_MARTA_API_KEY environment variable. Then run <code>npm run app-install</code> and then <code>npm start</code> from the root directory. Once both steps are completed you should see the app operate in real time from there.

Thanks!
